### Week 0: TPT 5.1-5.2 and TT0

#### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

- One harmful effect of computing is children and teens can get mental and emotional damage if they become obsessed with gaming and or social media. Another harmful effect of computing is it can be dangerous for young kids, as the internet allows for young children to access things they should not. Although there are many harmful effects of computing, it also allows for people from all over the world to connect with one another through the power of the internet.
- The dopamine issues mentioned above are real issues that are going on in our world today. Many people struggle from an addition to something that releases dopamine into their brain giving them a sense of happiness even for a short period of time. Many teens receive dopamine from social media or video games that causes unhealthy habits. Personally, I feel distracted from my everyday life as I find myself on my phone, on tik tok, or on any type of social media instead of doing my school work. But I also receive dopamine from getting good grades which causes major conflict in my life.

#### 5.2 Digital Divide

  - There are many ways people are able to empower themselves digitally, people use social media to express themselves and they are able to expand what they love and share what they love with millions of people around the world.
  - Something I could do to help empower someone who does not feel empowered is educate people about the digital divide and emphasize that we are very privileged where we live at Del Norte and that we should give back to those who are not as fortunate.
  - Red Tape is blocking full digital empowerment at Del Norte. At Del Norte we have very limited access, and as a student who is interested in computer science I find it very limiting on the things I can do as I have very limited access on the internet at Del Norte.
