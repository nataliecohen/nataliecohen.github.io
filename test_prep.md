### Week 0: TPT 5.1-5.2 and TT0

#### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

- One harmful effect of computing is children and teens can get mental and emotional damage if they become obsessed with gaming and or social media. Another harmful effect of computing is it can be dangerous for young kids, as the internet allows for young children to access things they should not. Although there are many harmful effects of computing, it also allows for people from all over the world to connect with one another through the power of the internet.
- The dopamine issues mentioned above are real issues that are going on in our world today. Many people struggle from an addition to something that releases dopamine into their brain giving them a sense of happiness even for a short period of time. Many teens receive dopamine from social media or video games that causes unhealthy habits. Personally, I feel distracted from my everyday life as I find myself on my phone, on tik tok, or on any type of social media instead of doing my school work. But I also receive dopamine from getting good grades which causes major conflict in my life.

#### 5.2 Digital Divide

  - There are many ways people are able to empower themselves digitally, people use social media to express themselves and they are able to expand what they love and share what they love with millions of people around the world.
  - Something I could do to help empower someone who does not feel empowered is educate people about the digital divide and emphasize that we are very privileged where we live at Del Norte and that we should give back to those who are not as fortunate.
  - Red Tape is blocking full digital empowerment at Del Norte. At Del Norte we have very limited access, and as a student who is interested in computer science I find it very limiting on the things I can do as I have very limited access on the internet at Del Norte.

#### Computing Bias 5.3

# Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify your conclusion.

- Based on the video, I do not think the owner of the computer believes that this was the intention. I do not think the owner believes that the computer company purposefully decided to make the computer to where it does not face track black people.  

# How do you think this happened?

- Something within the computer programming must be flawed to where it does not pick up ‘darker skin colors’. 

# Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or excluded?

- I do not believe that it was meant to be harmful in any way, but it can be seen as a very detrimental flaw that can lead people to believe that not necessarily the computer itself is racist, but the owners of the company have different morals and beliefs that they portray within their products. 

# Should it be corrected?

- Yes! This problem needs to be addressed ASAP because it can give a bad rep for the company as they are seen as ‘racist’ against a certain population of people which could be very harmful to the company. 

# What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

- I would relook at all of the program because there is obviously a major flaw within the program that needs to be fixed. I would also take all of the computers off of the market and create an apology statement saying that we are a company that does not stand for this, while making a new computer that fully fixes this problem.
