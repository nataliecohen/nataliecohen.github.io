### Program overview:

This program will portray dashes that represent the number of letters in a certain word. Today in the world, there is a very popular game called Wordle that many people play. I decided to take the idea of wordle and create my own word guessing game. There is a selection of words that are randomly selected. The user is given no hints and just begin to enter letters that they believe could be in the word. If they are correct, the user grows one step closer to guessing the correct word, but if they are wrong the user continues to input letters until told they are correct. This program is intented to be a game/puzzle used by the user. 

#### Functionality of the Program: 
This program has the user input letters from the alphabet and the output is the letters in the correct spot, or a message telling the user they are incorrect and to continue guessing.
